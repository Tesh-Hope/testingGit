# testingGit
just testing git for the first time
this is my first text file 
so i was just checking and thought i could do something new and then i realise that it doesnot do anything if the organisation deny my request to join them and so i am back into my very own project.

and now i am going to do it from another branch for just testing purpost just merge if you think it looks cool, thank you.
